The development sources are available through anonymous CVS at Savannah:

Autotools
---------
This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from git (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.


Building
--------
After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  sh ./autogen.sh
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed, as
follows:


Gettext
-------
When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system, it
is necessary to run gettextize -f in this hierarchy to update the po/
infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun gnulib-tool --import since
otherwise older files will have been imported.  See the Gnulib manual
for more information.

The development sources are available through anonymous CVS at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=recutils


Autotools
---------
This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from git (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

Dependencies
------------

There are some third party dependencies needed to build some of the
utilities shipped in this distribution.  The configure script checks
for the needed packages and drives the conditional compilation of the
impacted utitilities.  The dependencies are:
- csv2rec depends on libcsv, available at http://libcsv.sf.net
- mdb2rec depends on glib 2.0 and libmdb, available at
  http://mdbtools.sf.net.

Building
--------
After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  sh ./autogen.sh
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed, as
follows:


Gettext
-------
When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system, it
is necessary to run gettextize -f in this hierarchy to update the po/
infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun gnulib-tool --import since
otherwise older files will have been imported.  See the Gnulib manual
for more information.


Adding new Tests
----------------
When adding new unit tests to the test suite in 'torture/', please
remember to update the TESTS recfile launching the following command
from the root of the distribution:
  $ ./build-aux/get-test-data torture > TESTS
And then make sure everything is ok in the file with:
  $ recfix TESTS

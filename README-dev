The development sources are available through anonymous git at Savannah:
  http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=recutils


Autotools
---------
This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from git (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

Flex
----
You will need a recent version of flex, since we are using some recent
options like "reentrant" or "bison-bridge".  flex version 2.5.35 works
fine.

Dependencies
------------
There are some third party dependencies needed to build some of the
utilities shipped in this distribution.  The configure script checks
for the needed packages and drives the conditional compilation of the
impacted utitilities.  The dependencies are:
- The testing infrastructure uses the Check library.  At the moment
  the svn version of the library if needed.  The configure script will
  check if you have the right version.  libcheck can be obtained at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/check/.

The following dependencies are optional.  Missing them will result in
a less capable software:
- The GNU Privacy Guard (gnupg) is required in order to support
  encryption.  The following libraries are required: libgpg-error and
  libgcrypt.  Any recent version of those libraries will work.  gnupg
  can be obtained at http://gnupg.org.
- libcurl is required for supporting remote descriptors.  Any
  recent version must work.  The library can be obtained at
  http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/.
- The mdbtools are required for building the mdb2rec utility.
  mdbtools can be obtained at http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net.
- The UUID library from Theodore Ts'o is required for the uuid type.
  In Debian-like systems that library is packaged under the name
  uuid-dev and the runtime under the name libuuid1.
- The algol68toc compiler is required for building the Algol68
  bindings.

Building
--------
After getting the git sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  ./bootstrap
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.

When modifying the sources, or making a distribution, more is needed, as
follows:

Gettext
-------
When updating gettext, besides the normal installation on the system, it
is necessary to run gettextize -f in this hierarchy to update the po/
infrastructure.  After doing so, rerun gnulib-tool --import since
otherwise older files will have been imported.  See the Gnulib manual
for more information.

Adding new Tests
----------------
When adding new unit tests to the test suite in 'torture/', please
remember to update the TESTS recfile launching the following command
from the root of the distribution:
  $ ./build-aux/get-test-data torture > TESTS
And then make sure everything is ok in the file with:
  $ recfix TESTS

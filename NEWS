 Version 1.4 (03 November 2011)
* Support for encryption with the new %confidential special field.
* Support for named types with the new %typedef special field.
* Support for sorting with the new %sort special field.
* Recutils support for org-babel is now included in the distribution
  as ob-rec.el.  It allows to read rec data into org documents in both
  raw and table formats.
* It is now possible to use double quotes for delimiting string
  literals in selection expressions, as well as single quotes.
  Unescapted newline characters are also supported.
* The manual has been vastly improved.
* recfix now supports several operations: check, sort, encrypt and
  decrypt.
* recins now generates parseable locale independent dates when
  generating time-stamps in auto-fields.
* Lots of bug fixes.

 Version 1.3 (11 February 2011)
* A quite bad (and embarrassing) bug introduced in 1.2 has been
  fixed.  The bug was causing recins, recdel and recset to report
  random integrity failures, due to a uninitialized variable.
* New special field %size, that allows to define constraints in the
  size of record sets.
* Several fixes in the user manual.
* Little portability issue that prevented one of the tests to compile
  in macos x has been fixed.
* Translations updates.

 Version 1.2 (4 February 2011)
* New utility rec2csv, to export rec data to csv files.
* Support for auto-incremented fields and timestamps with the new
  %auto field in record descriptors.
* Support for comments in enum type descriptions.
* recset now supports a new "set or add field" operation, implementing
  the common case of setting the value of a field in case it exists,
  or else add it to the record.
* The flavor of regular expressions accepted in both selection
  expressions and type descriptions is now documented in the user
  manual.
* Translations for German, Finnish, Swedish and Ducht.
* recdel now performs an integrity check before to complete the
  deletion.
* The utilities no longer "expand" the contents of remote descriptors
  in the local ones.
* recset and recins no longer destroy the permissions of the rec file
  that is being modified.
* Many fixes in the documentation.
* Lots of bug fixes.

 Version 1.1 (24 December 2010)
* New utility recfmt, to format records based on templates.
* Improvements in selection expressions:
  . Support ranges in field subscripts.
  . New date operators: before (<<), after (>>) and sametime (==).
  . New ternary conditional operator (?:).
  . New string concatenation operator (&).
* libcsv is now embedded in the source distribution, so it is no
  longer required to have it installed to build csv2rec.
* Portability problems fixed.  The programs have been tested in the
  following systems:
  . GNU/Linux
  . FreeBSD 6.4
  . MacOS X
  . mingw32
  . Solaris 8
  . AIX 5.1
  . HP-UX 11.00
